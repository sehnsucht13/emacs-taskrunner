* Emacs Taskrunner
This is an elisp library which aims to provide a way to retrieve all of the
tasks/targets from various build systems and execute them in a compilation buffer.

The ultimate goal is to use this library to provide the data necessary for an
interactive interface through helm/ivy/ido which will let the user select tasks
and run them. Additionally, it will also provide a task caching mechanism so the
tasks do not have to be retrieved over and over again.

*Warning*: I have not worked with most of these build systems/taskrunners but
 support has been provided for them. Since my knowledge is fairly elementary, I
 might miss some subtleties. If you have any advice then please feel free to
 open a pull request/issue on this repository. Thanks
 
* Installation
To install this library, you will need the following dependencies:
- Emacs version 25.1 and above
- [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]] 
- [[https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async][emacs-async]] 

In addition, you will also need to install one(or more if you would like) of
these frontends:
- [[https://github.com/emacs-taskrunner/ivy-taskrunner][ivy-taskrunner]] 
- [[https://github.com/emacs-taskrunner/helm-taskrunner][helm-taskrunner]] 
- Ido frontend is still in progress. Please use one of the other 2 for now.
* Project Status
Currently, this project is stable. It makes quite a lot of assumptions about
build/taskrunner configuration files being present at the root only and not
nested in the file hierarchy of the project.
** Supported Systems
It can be used for the following systems/frontends listed below.

**** User interfaces

- [ ] ido (Work in progress. Coming Soon!)
** Planned improvements
- [ ] Use ripgrep/ag/grep to locate task files. This will help find nested
  Makefiles and other task files which need to be parsed.
- [ ] Add Smart/Dumb support. Smart support will use ripgrep/ag/grep and "Dumb"
  support will work very similarly to the way it is done now. This is if the
  user does not have any of those installed or they would not like to spawn too
  many ripgrep/ag/grep processes on their system.
- [ ] Add support for more taskrunners/build systems.
*** Planning to add support for
- [ ] Apache maven

- [ ] Bazel
- [ ] msbuild(Maybe)
* API
The API for taskrunner is slowly being documented [[file:api-doc.org][here]]. It is not yet complete
but the majority of the basics are there.
* Design Choices
** Async vs Sync
This library comes with both sync and async functions. Originally, everything
worked synchronously but obviously Emacs froze and was unresponsive. For most
taskrunners/build systems, it took only 1-3 seconds for the tasks to be
retrieved. On the other hand most Java based systems(gradle is the worst) will
take 5-9 seconds to start up and spit out a list of tasks. As a result,
~emacs-async~ was used as a way to avoid freezing the UI while tasks were being
retrieved. 

Under the hood, this whole library is synchronous and starts synchronous
processes in order to coordinate the way tasks are retrieved. Most projects use
a single build system/taskrunner but for others(web projects for example) might
use multiple(gulp and package.json/npm scripts and so on...). If the tasks are
retrieved asynchronously from the start then it becomes very difficult to
synchronize the way the tasks are added to caches and might cause data
races. Emacs 26 brought mutexes but those will freeze the UI as well while they
are waiting.
** Threads vs ~emacs-async~ 
Emacs 26 brough threads but they are cooperative. This means that processes
which take a long time(cough, cough, Gradle and its daemon) will still freeze
the UI even when being ran on a separate thread. Due to this, ~emacs-async~ is
used even though the Emacs which runs this library might have threads available.
